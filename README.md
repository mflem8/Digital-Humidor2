# README

Digital Humidor is a simple Rails app that allows users to keep track of their favorite cicgars. Users can view their own cigars as well as cigars tracked by other users. A user may sign up directly through the app, or with Google. Users can browse cigars they've added previously, add new cigars, leave ratings and reviews.
